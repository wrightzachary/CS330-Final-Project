# CS330-Final-Project

1. How do I approach designing software?
  - When I am designing software, whether that is for my  school work or stories at work, I always start by truly understanding the requirements given. Once I fully undertsand what I am supposed to create I start looking into what I could do to test what I am creating; I use Test Driven Devlopment (TDD) as much as I can, but was not able to this class. In the intance I do not write my unit tests, I then start brainstorming the overall structure of the project and different algorithms that can be used for the given problem. Once I have all this information I then use it to start developing my files starting with the C++ files this time and moving to each header directly after that C++ file was finished; I refactor as needed. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  - As previously stated above I use TDD as much as possible but even though that this was not possible this class I was able to do so. For this class I took into consideration the task at hand each week and gather information to complete assignments each week fromt he provided tutorials. Each week I used the tutorials as my boiler plate code and was able to complete my assignments with a better understanding. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - My current BSCS pusuit will help me be a stonger canidate in the tech field, already working as a Java Developer, this course has helped me fine tune some of my skillsets. A skill that was stregnthed during this course would be my ability to debug and that will be important in my career as I work towards my goal at working for a major tech company. A new skill I leanred is using OpenGL with C++.
